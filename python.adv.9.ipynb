    "\n",
    "Unicode Support: In Python 2.x, there were two string types: ASCII strings (str) and Unicode strings (unicode). However, in Python 3.x, the str type represents Unicode strings by default. This means that all strings are Unicode strings, and you can work with characters from different languages and scripts without encoding/decoding concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding/Decoding: In Python 3.x, explicit encoding and decoding are necessary when working with bytes or non-Unicode strings. You need to convert between bytes and strings using the encode() and decode() methods or functions, specifying the desired encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print Statement: The print statement in Python 2.x is replaced with the print() function in Python 3.x. This change requires parentheses around the arguments and affects how you print strings and variables to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode Literals: In Python 2.x, Unicode literals are represented by the u'...' syntax. In Python 3.x, Unicode strings are expressed using regular string literals, allowing the direct representation of Unicode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte Strings: In Python 3.x, byte strings (sequences of raw bytes) are represented using the bytes type instead of the str type in Python 2.x. This distinction is crucial when working with binary data or when interacting with external systems that require byte-level manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text I/O: Python 3.x introduces specific file modes for text and binary I/O ('t' and 'b', respectively), emphasizing the distinction between text and binary data. This change affects how you open files and handle their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration and Comparison: The behavior of iteration and comparison operations between strings and bytes has changed in Python 3.x. In Python 2.x, strings and bytes could be implicitly compared, but in Python 3.x, comparing strings and bytes of different types raises a TypeError."
